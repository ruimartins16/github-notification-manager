## 🚀 Installation

### From Chrome Web Store (Recommended)
1. Visit [GitHush on the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/githush/adfddlpecaeahdfjaelpagfmeaddcpcd)
2. Click "Add to Chrome"
3. Click the GitHush icon in your extensions bar
4. Sign in with GitHub
5. Start managing notifications your way!

> **Using GitHub in a company/organization?** If your org restricts OAuth apps, notifications from that org's private repositories won't appear until an organization owner approves GitHush. Go to [github.com/settings/applications](https://github.com/settings/applications) → GitHush → "Organization access" and click **Request** (or **Grant** if you're an owner). One approval covers every member of the org. This is a GitHub security policy that applies to all third-party notification tools.
