# Extension Icons

Place your extension icons here:
- icon16.png (16x16)
- icon48.png (48x48)

For now, using placeholder icons. Replace these with proper designs before Chrome Web Store submission.

You can create these using:
- Figma
- Photoshop
- Online icon generators
- Fiverr ($50 budget as per LANDING-PAGE.md)

Design guidelines:
- Simple, recognizable icon
- Works at small sizes (16x16)
- GitHub-inspired colors (blue accent)
